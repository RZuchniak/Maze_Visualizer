# Python A* Maze Visualizer

The pathfinder takes a maze from maze.txt and solves it while providing a visualization of the solution using Pygame

<h3> To edit maze: </h3>
Change the values in maze.txt

<ul>
<li> Wall: # </li>
<li> Path: p </li>
</ul>

First and last columns may only have 1 path block each as these represent the beginning and end of the maze
